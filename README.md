This project is a way for students to be able to do experiments in a virtual chemistry lab, whether or not their classes have labs built into them at their school. This lab teaches acid base chemistry and how adding a base to an acid will increase its pH. They are able to visibly see that with indicators. As the pH of the solution changes, the color will change as well, as a result of the indicator. The two indicators that are being used are phenolphthalein and bromothyol blue. The phenolphthalein demonstrates a colorless, acidic solution turning pink after adding a base and the bromothyol blue solution shows a yellow, acidic solution turning green after adding a little bit of base and blue after adding a lot of base. This is a very user friendly experience with instructions everywhere that they look, but experienced users have the option to skip over these instructions if they please. There are also multiple methods in place to prevent motion sickness, such as snap turning and teleportation as the form of locomotion.
Overall, this was a very fun, but challenging experience to make. Incorporating the liquid pouring was one of the most challenging, but rewarding parts of this project. That part was done by utilizing part of the watering can asset from the Unity Learn XRI Sample, but I modified it to better suit the needs for the game. 
I hope you enjoy!
